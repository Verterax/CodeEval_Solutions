# CodeEval_Solutions
Over 120 coding challenge solutions from CodeEval.com completed in C++.

 I coded these challenges in visual studio. Some of these solutions include text input files. The folder structure has been retained such that anyone attempting to run the project can automatically make use of the sample input.
 
 I wrote these solutions between 2014 and 2016.
 
 CodeEval.com itself was acquired in 2017 by HireVue so unfortunately these solutions are without problem descriptions. Enjoy?
